Ingredients:
 - rice
 - water
 
Directions:
 1. Put however much rice you'd like to in a pot.
 2. Depending on how firm/soft you'd like the rice, put 1.5-2x as much water in the pot.
 	More water makes the rice softer.
 3. Heat the water and bring it to a boil.
 4. Lower the heat and cover the pot. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all water is gone.
